">Unconference 2k17</h1> 
<big><p><strong>&quot;Unconference&quot;</strong> is an entrepreneurial summit designed to take you on a journey where you understand the bits and pieces of developing an enterprise. It is aimed at imbibing the spirit of entrepreneurship and creating future change-makers and leaders. Unconference, themed around a <strong>case study based approach</strong> will include a <strong>series of workshops</strong> , <strong>focused talks</strong> on relevant topics and a <strong>Startup Walk.</strong> The objective is to set a framework for you to take up any problem and solve with the correct entrepreneurial approach.</p>
<p>With startups growing out of each and every corner of the country, students are not far behind in the scene. A lot of students enter this space to solve a problem but due to the lack of experience and fierce competition out there, millions of ideas or so to say potential multi-national companies get lost. Unconference will guide you to approach some of the most pressing problems in today's world correctly.</p>
<p>Students who are driven to create impact and bring about change in society are strongly encouraged to register for this insightful conference. This event is ideal for <strong>aspiring entrepreneurs</strong> looking to hone their problem solving skills.</p></big><br>
