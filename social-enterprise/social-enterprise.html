">Run the Social Enterprise</h1> 
<p>Are you deeply concerned regarding the social issues the country is facing? Motivated to start their own venture to tackle these issues? We at E-Cell IIT Madras feel it is imperative to encourage intelligent and driven students to make an impact and let India realise its growth story through innovative social startups.
</p>

<p>E-Cell IIT Madras presents <strong>“Run The Social Enterprise“</strong> one of our flagship Events for E-Summit 2017 in association with India’s Largest youth driven NGO - Bhumi. The event is a team based case study competition where you can step into the shoes of a social entrepreneur and solve case studies based on real problems faced by Bhumi and propose innovative solutions.
</p>
 
<p>The Competition will take place in 2 rounds:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Preliminary Online round: </strong>In this round you will select one of the problem statements and submit a preliminary solution in the form of an online presentation . This preliminary solution should not be longer than 5-6 slides.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Final round:</strong>The final round will be spread over 2 days and take place at IIT Madras campus. On the first day Bhumi will provide valuable insights into how you can refine your solutions. On the second day you will present your fully developed solution to Bhumi. The top 2 teams will be selected. These teams will be provided with a prize pool of INR 25,000 (INR 15,000 to the Winners and INR 10,000 to Runners Up) and will receive an opportunity to implement their solutions with Bhumi over the summer.
</li>
